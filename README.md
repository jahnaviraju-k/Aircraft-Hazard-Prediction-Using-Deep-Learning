# Malware Detection for Health Sensor Data
# Overview 
This project focuses on using machine learning to detect potential malware threats embedded in health sensor code an important step for securing IoT and medical devices. The system uses labeled datasets and ensemble learning models to flag suspicious patterns in code behavior.
# Problem
Malware embedded in health sensor firmware or code can compromise patient data and device functionality. I wanted to build a model that detects such patterns based on behavioral features from sensor code samples.

# How I Did It
1. Data Understanding & Preprocessing:
- Collected labeled datasets with code snippets and metadata showing malware vs benign behavior.

- Performed data cleaning: removed nulls, normalized values, and encoded categorical features.

2. Feature Engineering:
- Extracted static features (e.g., opcode frequency, function calls, code size) and behavioral signals (e.g., communication patterns).

- Applied feature selection techniques to remove noisy features and reduce dimensionality.

3. Model Training:
- Trained multiple models: Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

- Used cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

- Balanced the dataset using SMOTE to improve class representation.

4. Model Evaluation
- Measured performance using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

- XGBoost achieved the best trade-off between recall and precision, detecting malware with high reliability.

# Results
- Achieved ~95% accuracy on test data.

- Final model generalized well on unseen samples, showing potential for real-world deployment in embedded device security.

# Civil Aircraft Hazard Prediction Using (LSTM) Deep Learning
# Overview
This project uses time-series deep learning (LSTM) to predict hazardous events in civil aircraft, based on APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) sensor data. The aim is to detect patterns that precede faults or anomalies in engine operation, helping improve aviation safety.

# Problem
Aircraft contain sensors (e.g., APU sensors) that record signals during flight. I aimed to detect hazardous events in advance using this time-series data.

# How I Did It
1. Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded APU sensor data (time-series).

- Cleaned and normalized data to ensure consistent time intervals.

- Handled missing values using interpolation and padding.

2. Feature Engineering:
- Calculated statistical features: rolling averages, signal deltas, and custom domain-specific indicators.

- Used RFECV (Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation) to reduce input noise and improve model focus.

3. Time-Series Modeling:
- Transformed the dataset into sliding time windows to feed into the LSTM model (e.g., 10-step sequences).

- Built and trained an LSTM model using either TensorFlow or PyTorch.

- Included dropout layers to avoid overfitting and added early stopping during training.

4. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluated on a test set using F1-score, accuracy, and confusion matrix.

- Fine-tuned model architecture and learning rate to stabilize training.

# Results
- Final LSTM model achieved around 92% accuracy.

- Detected hazard patterns with high recall, making it useful for predictive maintenance systems in aviation.
